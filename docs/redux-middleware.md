#Redux Middleware

##Adding middlewares
In the past we have ended up in a stituation where we have a mess of redux middlewares that easily conflict with eachother
and cause unexpected behaviour and bugs. The list of middlewares has now been minimised so it's easier to maintain the codebase.

Before adding new middlewares, please give the implications a full analysis in order to avoid that situation in the future.
