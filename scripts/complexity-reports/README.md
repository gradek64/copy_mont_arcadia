###Running locally
To display the complexity reports, it is required to run an **Http Server** inside the **scripts/complexity-reports** folder (to avoid CORS issues when requesting the dependencies) and open index.html.

Examples of Http Servers:
1. `npm install http-server -g`, run `http-server scripts/complexity-report` and go to **http://localhost:8080**
2. IntelliJ and WebStorm use an HTTP Server out of the box when opening HTML files


### 1. Code Coverage Report

The purpose of this report is to merge the coverage data generated by Jest.

The reports displays as well the number of commits that have affected each file during the last 6 months, to make it easier to see which files are changed most often.

The report receives as input 2 files: jest coverage reports and the git history file.

#### Jest coverage report

The report is generated by running the following command at the root of the project:

`npm run jest:coverage`

The coverage file that we need for the custom report is **coverage/coverage-summary.json**

This is generated by the **json-summary** reporter

#### Git history file

This file is generated by running the following command at the root of the project:

`./scripts/complexity-reports/generate-reports.sh`

The file contains a list of files that have been changed during past 6 months together with the number of commits affecting each file and is located in:

`scripts/complexity-reports/generated-reports`

### 2. Cyclomatic Complexity Reports

There are 2 Cyclomatic Complexity reports, one for the source code and one for the tests.

The source code report displays the cyclomatic complexity for all the functions, while the tests report displays only the functions that have the cyclomatic complexity equal or grater than 2, to improve the performance of sorting the table.

The reports receive as input 2 files: the eslint output for the tests and the one for the source code. They are generated by running the following command:

`./scripts/complexity-reports/generate-reports.sh`

in the folder:

`scripts/complexity-reports/generated-reports`
